In my university DSU, The time table that is issued to students is not user friendly and at its initial launch it has a lot of clashes. The time table for Computer Science is mixed with students of all semesters. That makes it more congested and hard to read.   - First I had to implement modern Object Oriented concepts in the project so I have two projects with one idea.  1/- A website created using HTML,CSS and Javascript using timetable.js library to show it's scalability over the the DSU campus, Along with current time table,  room number and teachers free time schedule.  2/- A console-based application with modern object oriented programming concepts implemented which makes it relevant to the course.
